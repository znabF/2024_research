I'm feeling angry.Oh, yes! I'm mad!I'm angry.No.I'm going to get you a cup of coffee.Take a bullie, a bob, take a bullie, a bullie, a bullie, a bullie, a bullie.Oh, yo, yo, yo, go in the old love.Ha ha ha ha! Shooversa ke kani pate kani bodya ni!I don't know if you can tell me what I'm doing. I'm just going to go to the bathroom.Morning, honey.In theory, so much that I want to punch a hole in the wall.Bye bye.I'm weak and what's wrong?
